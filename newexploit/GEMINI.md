## Project Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating a sandbox escape vulnerability on iOS (tested on versions up to 26.2b1). It leverages maliciously crafted SQLite databases (`downloads.28.sqlitedb` and `BLDatabaseManager.sqlite`) to abuse the download mechanisms of the `itunesstored` and `bookassetd` daemons.

The primary goal of the exploit is to write arbitrary files owned by the `mobile` user to restricted locations within the `/private/var/` directory. The PoC specifically demonstrates spoofing the device type by modifying the MobileGestalt cache file (`com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist`).

The key files in this directory are the components of the PoC:
- `BLDatabaseManager.sqlite`: A crafted SQLite database for the first stage of the exploit targeting `itunesstored`.
- `downloads.28.sqlitedb`: A crafted SQLite database for the `bookassetd` daemon.
- `iPhone13,2_26.0.1_MobileGestalt.epub`: An EPUB file that serves as the payload, likely containing the modified `com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist`.
- `iTunesMetadata.plist`: Metadata file that might be used in conjunction with the exploit.

## Building and Running

This project is a proof-of-concept for a security vulnerability and does not have traditional build or run scripts. The files are meant to be used in a specific context on an iOS device to trigger the vulnerability.

**There are no build or execution commands provided.** The repository is for educational purposes to demonstrate the vulnerability. For more details on the exploit, refer to the associated (but unlinked) blog post mentioned in the `README.md`.

## Development Conventions

As a security PoC, this project does not follow typical software development conventions. There are no tests, and the code/data is highly specific to the vulnerability being demonstrated.
